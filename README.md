An example of "proper" object-oriented design.

## Design considerations:
- Separation of concerns
- Encapsulation of behaviour
- Minimum exposure of internal state
- Loose coupling
- The right amount of specificity in naming

## Tests
The logic is "properly" unit tested:
- Randomised data used
- No targetting of internal states
- No checking of internally invoked behaviour
